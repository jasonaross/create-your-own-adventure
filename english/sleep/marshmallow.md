When you wake up, you're still in the strange room with marshmallows for walls.
The walls smell really good, but are they tasty?

It would be nice to find out, but not all by themselves.
You need something to go with them.
Maybe some chocolate.

You wish there were some chocolate furniture too.

And suddenly your wish come true, the chocolate furniture appears,
and you start thinking is it really possible,
whatever i think will come true.

You consider ensuring that every child in the world has the economic
conditions for a full education, including music. You consider wishing
for a breakthrough on fusion research, to allow a higher level of energy
and economic development, and the potential for powered, rather than
inertial, rocket trajectories to Mars and beyond. Or...

You think if you should wish there was a way to melt these chocolates
